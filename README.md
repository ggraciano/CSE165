# CSE165 - Introduction to Object Oriented Programming

This repository contains lab assignments and a project designed around the programming paradigm that focuses on data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. Each of the lab assignments explore one of the four principles behind object-oritented programmig, that is, abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Moreover, the lab assignments introduce different tools to be utilized for the project. Written in C++ and utilizing OpenGL, the lab assignments and project correspond with the following tasks:

1. lab_01 - Display your initials
2. lab_02 - Create a working Tic-Tac-Toe game
3. lab_03 - Create a MS Paint clone
4. lab_04 - Render text
5. lab_05 - Animate a running cat
6. lab_06 - Animate an explosion
7. project_01 - Create a game
